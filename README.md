# **Advanced Lane Finding**
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

This repository contains my implementation of the homonymous open source [project](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines) part of the [Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](http://www.udacity.com/drive). Keep in mind that I didn't enroll in the program.

For a step by step walkthrough of the project and an overview of the theory used see [here](https://iacopomc.github.io/projects/2020-07-15-advanced-lane-finding-project/) and [here](https://iacopomc.github.io/blog/advanced-lane-finding/)

For the camera calibration part you can check out the Jupyter notebook in [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Camera-Calibration)
